# A-B-Testing
### This project is an A/B testing Python project using Pandas, Numpy,
Matplotlib, and Statsmodels to determine if a new page should be
implemented on an e-commerce website to increase user conversion rate,
I used multiple models including hypothesis testing, A/B testing, multiple
linear regression, and logistic regression.
