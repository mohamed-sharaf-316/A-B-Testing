# A-B-Testing
### This project is an A/B testing Python project using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.
### The project's purpose is to determine if a new page should be implemented on an e-commerce website to increase user conversion rate.
### I used multiple models including hypothesis testing, A/B testing, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
